Setup: Obtain public parameters.
Preprocessing: Preprocess the purchased database, including locking each group of insignificant bits.
Verification1: Verify the commitment for each group of significant bits and generate parameter z for each group of insignificant bits.
Verification2: Verify the returned message (i.e., decoded result) for each group of insignificant bits.
All the location, database, parameter information in the source code are required to be replaced by their new values according to the simulation environment. All of them are labeled as "XX".
